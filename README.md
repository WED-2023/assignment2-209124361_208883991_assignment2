# Halaliot Game Portal 🎮

This project is a classic 2D shooting game built using **Vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **jQuery**. It was developed as part of a web development course.

## 🕹️ About the Game

- Speed increases every 5 seconds (up to 4 times)
- Visual score feedback and high score tracking
- Configurable controls, ship colors, and game duration
- Background music and sound effects (shooting, hits, defeat)
- Responsive UI with login, registration, and configuration screens
- Game ends on victory, disqualification, or time limit
